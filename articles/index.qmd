There are many articles written about Sam throughout the American Yiddish press. 
I am currently in the process of making their translations available.

## Birthdays

Sam's 50th, 60th, 70th, and 80th birthdays were commemorated by the Yiddish theater community. 
Sam was most likely born in 1869, so some of these birthday years are a bit off, but such is a sign of the times!

Each link below will take you to the given article translation:
