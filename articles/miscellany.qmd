_Sha_, {{< var sam-full >}} speaks out^["let's himself be heard"]. The lively comedian's New York _patriotn_^[his group of ardent fans/followers] are despondent. {{< var sam-full >}} left to perform in the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia^[See a [timeline of {{< var sam >}}'s whereabouts](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/appendices/timeline.html)], and without him their joy has all dried up^[I was unable to translate this, but I believe the meaning is preserved; אויס, ניטאָ איהם, וויא אין וואסער אריין].

Now, Reb {{< var sam >}} speaks out. He sent a letter to his _patriotn_ stating that he had a good night's sleep in Philadelphia, and now he's starting to get up and get active. He's going to be Shakespeare. He's going to shake things up in Philadelphia with a benefit performance, during which he'll appear in [Kalmanowitz](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/K/kalmanowitz-harry.htm)'s play, [_Shekspier der tsveyter_](https://www.loc.gov/item/2020729470/) (_Shakespeare the Second_).

This will be on December 7th, indeed in Philadelphia.

### What is "_korech_"^[_korech_ refers to the so-called "Hillel sandwich" eaten at the Passover seder: maror (bitter herb, often horseradish) between two pieces of matzah]? {.unnumbered}

> It's story, origins, and role in today's world

A lesson from Dr. Gibatsenerl^[This is definitely joke pseudonym name  - "give a tenner" (like a ten dollar bill); דר. גיבאצענערל]

Ladies and gentlemen!

It has been established that the invention of the ["Hillel sandwich"](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/117121/jewish/10-Korech-The-Hillel-Sandwich.htm) - the same Hillel of [_"Beis Hillel"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Hillel_and_Shammai), the [_tane_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaim)^[rabbinic sages who contributed to the Mishnah] Hillel with a deep soul and exceptional love for his fellow man. Hillel invented the sandwich as a gift for all mankind...

Hillel held that man can [learn the whole Torah on one foot](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/689306/jewish/On-One-Foot.htm). Well, the Torah sure, but why stop there - why shouldn't we also **eat** on one foot? _Nu_, so he invented the "_korech_," which Americans call a "sandwich."

In happier times, you knew what to expect from a sandwich: two pieces of bread and a lot of meat, or cheese, or sardines...

Or there's the "double decker" and the "{{< var sam-full >}} stage-sandwich"^[In this joke article, we learn that {{< var sam >}} apparently had a well-known very large sandwich named for him!], three stories high...

But now during war time^[This article was printed during World War II], the sandwich has lost its "essence," its "innards", its contents. All that remains is just two pieces of bread, _nebech_^["What a pity"]....


^[These two sentences are full of idioms, and translations may not be fully accurate.]There are restaurants where people don't cram your sandwich with Ibsen brand's _"gor"_....but with _"gornisht"_^[absolutely nothing]... There are restaurants that put the "great check"^[טשעק הגדול] in between two pieces of "toast"...

All in all, these days there are only two kinds of sandwiches - a meat sandwich without a trace of even a sardine, and a cheese sandwich with but a sliver of tomato instead of cheese.

In short, all that's left of the sandwich is its name, a tombstone of the great invention.
