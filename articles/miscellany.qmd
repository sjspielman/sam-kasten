_Sha_, {{< var sam-full >}} speaks out^["let's himself be heard"]. The lively comedian's New York _patriotn_^[his group of ardent fans/followers] are despondent. {{< var sam-full >}} left to perform in the Arch Street Theater in Philadelphia^[See a [timeline of {{< var sam >}}'s whereabouts](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/appendices/timeline.html)], and without him their joy has all dried up^[I was unable to translate this, but I believe the meaning is preserved; אויס, ניטאָ איהם, וויא אין וואסער אריין].

Now, Reb {{< var sam >}} speaks out. He sent a letter to his _patriotn_ stating that he had a good night's sleep in Philadelphia, and now he's starting to get up and get active. He's going to be Shakespeare. He's going to shake things up in Philadelphia with a benefit performance, during which he'll appear in [Kalmanowitz](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/K/kalmanowitz-harry.htm)'s play, [_Shekspier der tsveyter_](https://www.loc.gov/item/2020729470/) (_Shakespeare the Second_).

This will be on December 7th, indeed in Philadelphia.
