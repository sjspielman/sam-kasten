Following a brief illness, the 88-year old^[Again, he was actually 83. It's not clear where 88 came from.] famous Yiddish performer {{< var sam-full >}} pass away. This evening, his body will be transported to Schwartz's Funeral Parlor at 2nd and 10th.

The funeral will take place tomorrow, Friday, at 12 pm in Philadelphia at Rosenberg's Funeral Parlor, 2009 N Broad St.

A representative from the Hebrew Actor's Union, where the deceased was beloved and esteemed, will take part in the funeral^[The representative was [Sholem Perlmutter](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/P/perlmutter-sholem.htm). The article he wrote about his experience is translated below].

{{< var sam-full >}} ע׳׳ה^[עליו–השלום; may peace be upon him] was one of the most highly sought-after comedians in Yiddish operettas, and he was beloved by Jewish audiences across America and Europe^[Note that we don't actually have any specific knowledge that he ever traveled to Europe; he either did tour Europe but we do not have a record, or this is just embellishment.].

The last three years of his life, {{< var sam-full >}} didn't perform any longer. Before then, he would appear before audiences once a year or so for a special "honor-event"^[Performances specifially held to honor/benefit an actor; ערן–אָווענט] that his fans and friends would arrange for him. Prominent Yiddish actors would appear in these performances too. Old and age but full of life as ever, he {{< var sam-full >}} would also show up at the Actor's Union meetings, as well as at the Yiddish Actor's Club. 

{{< var sam-full >}} ע׳׳ה's death has brought a great sadness to the theater community.

**The happy and tragic {{< var sam-full >}}**

:::

By [Chaim Ehrenreich](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/E/ehrenreich-chaim.htm)

> He outlived his generation, his time, and indeed himself. -- A modest flower on his fresh grave.

The last few years of his life, {{< var sam-full >}} didn't perform any theater. The last time he appeared on the stage was three years ago at one of the special events honoring him that a few of his close friends used to arrange, sometimes in Second Avenue Theater, sometimes in Public Theater.Hundreds and thousands of his longtime fans used to come see him perform, shaking their heads in wonderment - look how he still dances! Look how youthful he is! And it did them a world of good to see, because if he, the old man {{< var kestin >}} who they remember from back in the old days, can move his feet like that and even do somersaults, then they too would be "alright." They could stay young just like him.

When they were still young scamps themselves, they saw him perform in Horowitz's _Der Poylisher Yingl_ and in Shaknovitch's _Immigranten_^[These plays, _The Polish Boy_ and _Immigrants_, were popular in the 1890s/1900s.]. {{< var kestin >}} performed in {{< var mogu >}}'s roles, immitating his older famous colleague but still with a {{< var kestin >}}-ishness in his acting. And he was the very best dancer, so light on his feet...

But for the last few years of his life, {{< var kestin >}} wasn't who he used to be. He was always joyful, always had a few jokes ready to go with a smile. But on the inside, when he was by himself, he was deeply uphappy. He had lost two fo this three children - his only daughter Lily^[She died of ovarian cancer in 1946 at the age of 48.] and his older son Fred^[He died of longterm lung complications from mustard gas exposure World War I in 1935 at the age of 39.]. He had lost his wife Suzie nine years ago^[She did in 1944.]. Like a true actor, he hid his true feelings from the world. But depressed he was.

Lola^[לאָלאַ; The pen name of [Leon Israel](https://www.jta.org/archive/leon-israel-jewish-artist-and-cartoonist-dies-was-67)], painter and {{< var forverts >}} cartoonist, grew very close to {{< var kestin >}} and took him under his wing. And {{< var kestin >}}, who was a couple decades older than Lola, called him _zayde_ and really clung to the much-younger Lola. More than once when {{< var kestin >}} made yet another excessive "_l'chaim_"^[a toast, and of course a drink!], Lola would tenderly wrap him up in his coat and take him back to his hotel.

He had lost his wife and two of his children. He also outlived the Yiddish theater, and indeed himself. And he was depressed, miserable - an _ibergeblibener_^[One who remains; evokes post-Holocaust Yiddish phrasing for the wretched survivors].

According to his son Lewis {{< var kestin >}}, he was more like a child than adult during the last two years of his life^[In other words, he had dementia.]. Nevertheless, from time to time he would regain his memory, and he'd slip out of the house and make for the Yiddish Actor's Club. They'd have to escort him back home.

One time in the last few months, when he came to the Actor's Union, he ran into the writer Sholem Perlmutter, took his hand, looked him in the eye and said:

"When - when it comes time for my funeral, come to Philadelphia and a few words about me."

And the words one could say about him are:

A piece of Yiddish theater is gone along with him. He was among the first there was, from the very start. He began acting in Singer's Hall in Brooklyn some 60 years ago. After that, he played real theater in Philadelphia in Franklin Theater. And from then on, he spent six decades performing in every city and state across America where Jews live.

He was more of a "buf"^[slapstick comedy] comedian than a character actor. He was easy, mischevious, and superficial, if you will, but with such charm. He was theater itself, through and through, with all the good and bad parts of the profession. His colleagues remember him as a good friend and partner, a _harziger mensch_.

Three weeks ago on a Sunday morning, during the blizzard in New York - the only snow storm we had this winter - {{< var sam-full >}} snuck of his hotel. He didn't know why he went out or where he was going. A few hours later, he was found half frozen to death on the shore of the East River. Not knowing who this ragged little old man with the head of white hair was, the police brought him to [City Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hospital_(Roosevelt_Island)) on [Welfare Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island). They later determine who he was and informed his son Lewis, but {{< var sam-full >}} was too weak and his temperature was too high to be taken home. 

So, he spent the last three weeks of his life on Welfare Island. None of his longtime friends or admirers knew where he was. Only his son and Charlie Cohan, the secretary of the Theatrical Alliance, came to him during the last days of his sad life. On Wednesday morning, his soul departed his body.

In the old days, when the likes of Mogulesko, David Kessler, or Jacob P. Adler passed away, grand funerals would be held. Fans would come in the thousands to bid them farewell. I want to believe that, in Philadelphia, scenes like this will also accompany {{< var sam-full >}} as he goes to his eternal rest. He wanted to be buried with his wife and children, and his wish was of course granted. Like every actor, he hoped for a grand funeral.

But I am afraid that the days of grand funeral processions are gone. Just another funeral for an actor who hasn't performed in years who outlived his generation and his time....

As one of {{< var sam-full >}}'s many friends - how often we would meet to _kibitz_ in the _theater-kibitzarnie_, Lola, myself, and Lola's "grandson"^[referring to Sam, who called Lola _"zayde"_] - I carry a modest flower to the joyous-tragic {{< var sam-full >}}.

Rest in peace, old friend.

By [Sholem Perlmutter](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/P/perlmutter-sholem.htm)

> A word on his fresh grave.

{{< var sam-full >}} lived his life quietly, withdrawn and very hospitable^[Possible mistranslation here? from אויף א זעהר שיינעם בעל–הבית–ישען אפון]. The Yiddish theater world remembers {{< var sam-full >}} from his prolific days when he created personalities and characters on the Yiddish stage. Many of them also know that with the death of {{< var sam-full >}}, the Yiddish theater world has lost a talented performer. He was one of the first. {{< var sam-full >}} was almost one of the pioneers who began in the {{< var heder >}} of {{< var goldfaden-full >}}. And throughout his entire career as a Yiddish actor, he was a mirror into those times.

Many remember when he was the the "buf"^[slapstick comedian] who sang couplets and danced. Many others also remember when he excelled in roles that {{< var mogu-full >}} played like "dos poylisher yingl"^[the Polish boy] from Professor Ish Horowitz Halevy; "Feitl Pavolye" in Nahum Meir Shaknovitch's (Shomer's) _Immigranten_. And the whole world remembers when he performed with David Kessler, Jacob P. Adler, and other notable personalities like Shildkraut. He really excelled in character-comedy roles.

But just as life doesn't stay forever in one place, neither do the performing arts, but instead evolves over time. The new young generation always steps up as capable performers who bring their own concepts and ideals to the stage. And in the end, these young performers emerge victorious because the old guard must give way to new, just as in life.

{{< var sam-full >}} was, in this case, an exception. He has always caught our eye and drawn our attention, because he absorbed the theater atmosphere along with his mother's milk. His later activities on the Yiddish stage helped him a lot to become a famous actor, comedian, and _mensch_ and made him immensely popular on the stage.

{{< var sam-full >}} was the first to bring ordinary comedy to the Yiddish stage. His possesses a terrific enthusiasm, a lot of impetuousness, a booming presence and tempestuousness. Theater audiences always looked upon him with wonderment. When {{< var sam-full >}} danced such that the stage floorboards would shake under his feet, he became energized and ignited with spirit, and his talent spilled out from him as he danced with a fiery passion in his eyes. He sang, danced, and burned with them. The great joy he derived from performing theater shook him up and gradually transformed into theatrical passion. He never grew tired and or apathetic, but always possessed an actor's ectasy. Both audiences and critics alike always held his talent in high esteem.
