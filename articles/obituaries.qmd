Sam Kasten ז׳׳ל passed away on March 4th, 1953 in New York City, just shy of his 84th birthday (April 21st). 
From obituaries below, we learn that he suffered dementia in his older years and passed away under very difficult and sad circumstances.

He is buried in [Har Jehuda cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_Jehuda_Cemetery) in Upper Darby, PA (outside of Philadelphia) with his wife (pictured below) and sons.

Following a brief illness, the 88-year old^[Again, he was actually 83. It's not clear where 88 came from.] famous Yiddish performer {{< var sam-full >}} passed away. This evening, his body will be transported to Schwartz's Funeral Parlor at 2nd and 10th.

The funeral will take place tomorrow, Friday, at 12 pm in Philadelphia at Rosenberg's Funeral Parlor, 2009 N Broad St.

A representative from the Hebrew Actor's Union, where the deceased was beloved and esteemed, will take part in the funeral^[The representative was [Sholem Perlmutter](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/P/perlmutter-sholem.htm). The article he wrote about his experience is [translated below](#march-17th-1953).].

{{< var sam-full >}} ע׳׳ה^[עליו–השלום; may peace be upon him] was one of the most highly sought-after comedians in Yiddish operettas, and he was beloved by Jewish audiences across America and Europe^[Note that we don't actually have any specific knowledge that he ever traveled to Europe; he either did tour Europe but we do not have a record, or this is just embellishment.].

The last three years of his life, {{< var sam-full >}} didn't perform any longer. Before then, he would appear before audiences once a year or so for a special "honor-event"^[Performances specifially held to honor/benefit an actor; ערן–אָווענט] that his fans and friends would arrange for him. Prominent Yiddish actors would appear in these performances too. Old and aged but full of life as ever, {{< var sam-full >}} would also show up at the Actor's Union meetings, as well as at the Yiddish Actor's Club. 

{{< var sam-full >}} ע׳׳ה's death has brought a great sadness to the theater community.

**The happy and tragic {{< var sam-full >}}**

:::

By [Chaim Ehrenreich](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/E/ehrenreich-chaim.htm)

> He outlived his generation, his time, and indeed himself. -- A modest flower on his fresh grave.

The last few years of his life, {{< var sam-full >}} didn't perform any theater. The last time he appeared on the stage was three years ago at one of the special events honoring him that a few of his close friends used to arrange, sometimes in Second Avenue Theater, sometimes in Public Theater. Hundreds and thousands of his longtime fans used to come see him perform, shaking their heads in wonderment - look how he still dances! Look how youthful he is! And it did them a world of good to see, because if he, the old man {{< var kestin >}} who they remember from back in the old days, can move his feet like that and even do somersaults, then they too would be "alright." They could stay young just like him.

When they were still young scamps themselves, they saw him perform in Horowitz's _Der Poylisher Yingl_ and in Shaknovitch's _Immigranten_^[These plays, _The Polish Boy_ and _Immigrants_, were popular in the 1890s/1900s.]. {{< var kestin >}} performed in {{< var mogu >}}'s roles, immitating his older famous colleague but still with a {{< var kestin >}}-ishness in his acting. And he was the very best dancer, so light on his feet...

But for the last few years of his life, {{< var kestin >}} wasn't who he used to be. He was always joyful, always had a few jokes ready to go with a smile. But on the inside, when he was by himself, he was deeply uphappy. He had lost two fo this three children - his only daughter Lily^[She died of ovarian cancer in 1946 at the age of 48.] and his older son Fred^[He died of longterm lung complications from mustard gas exposure World War I in 1935 at the age of 39.]. He had lost his wife Suzie nine years ago^[She did in 1944.]. Like a true actor, he hid his true feelings from the world. But depressed he was.

Lola^[לאָלאַ; The pen name of [Leon Israel](https://www.jta.org/archive/leon-israel-jewish-artist-and-cartoonist-dies-was-67)], painter and {{< var forverts >}} cartoonist, grew very close to {{< var kestin >}} and took him under his wing in the last few years. And {{< var kestin >}}, who was a couple decades older than Lola, called him _zayde_ and really clung to the much-younger Lola. More than once when {{< var kestin >}} wouldn make one-too-many "_l'chaim_"^[a toast, and of course a drink!], Lola would tenderly wrap him up in his coat and take him back to his hotel.

He had lost his wife and two of his children. He also outlived the Yiddish theater, and indeed himself. And he was depressed, miserable - an _ibergeblibener_^[One who remains; _somewhat_ evokes post-Holocaust Yiddish phrasing for the wretched survivors].

According to his son Lewis {{< var kestin >}}, he was more like a child than adult during the last two years of his life^[In other words, he had dementia.]. Nevertheless, from time to time he would regain his memory, and he'd slip out of the house and make for the Yiddish Actor's Club. They'd have to escort him back home.

One time in the last few months, when he came to the Actor's Union, he ran into the writer Sholem Perlmutter, took his hand, looked him in the eye and said:

"When - when it comes time for my funeral, come to Philadelphia and a few words about me."

And the words one could say about him are:

A piece of Yiddish theater is gone along with him. He was among the first there was, from the very start. He began acting in Singer's Hall in Brooklyn some 60 years ago. After that, he played real theater in Philadelphia in Franklin Theater. And from then on, he spent six decades performing in every city and state across America where Jews live.

He was more of a "buf"^[slapstick comedy] comedian than a character actor. He was easy, mischevious, and superficial, if you will, but with such charm. He was theater itself, through and through, with all the good and bad parts of the profession. His colleagues remember him as a good friend and partner, a _harziger mensch_.

Three weeks ago on a Sunday morning, during the blizzard in New York - the only snow storm we had this winter - {{< var sam-full >}} snuck out of his hotel. He didn't know why he went out or where he was going. A few hours later, he was found half frozen to death on the bank of the East River. Not knowing who this ragged little old man with the head of white hair was, the police brought him to [City Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hospital_(Roosevelt_Island)) on [Welfare Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island). They later determined who he was and informed his son Lewis, but {{< var sam-full >}} was too weak and his temperature was too high to be taken home. 

So, he spent the last three weeks of his life on Welfare Island. None of his longtime friends or admirers knew where he was. Only his son and [Charlie Cohan](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/C/cohan-charlie.htm), the secretary of the [Theatrical Alliance](https://www.moyt.org/yta/001.htm), came to him during the last days of his sad life. On Wednesday morning, his soul departed his body.

In the old days, when the likes of Mogulesko, David Kessler, or Jacob P. Adler passed away, grand funerals would be held. Fans would come in the thousands to bid them farewell. I want to believe that, in Philadelphia, scenes like this will also accompany {{< var sam-full >}} as he goes to his eternal rest. He wanted to be buried with his wife and children, and his wish was of course granted. Like every actor, he hoped for a grand funeral.

But I am afraid that the days of grand funeral processions are gone. Just another funeral for an actor who hasn't performed in years, who outlived his generation and his time....

As one of {{< var sam-full >}}'s many friends - how often we would meet to _kibitz_ in the _theater-kibitzarnie_, Lola, myself, and Lola's "grandson"^[referring to Sam, who called Lola _"zayde"_] - I carry a modest flower to the joyous-tragic {{< var sam-full >}}.

Rest in peace, old friend.

**{{< var sam-full >}}**

:::

By [Sholem Perlmutter](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/P/perlmutter-sholem.htm)

> A word on his fresh grave.

{{< var sam-full >}} lived his life quietly, withdrawn and in a very hospitable manner^[Possible mistranslation here? from אויף א זעהר שיינעם בעל–הבית–ישען אפון]. The Yiddish theater world remembers {{< var sam-full >}} from his prolific days when he created personalities and characters on the Yiddish stage. Many of them also know that with the death of {{< var sam-full >}}, the Yiddish theater world has lost a talented performer. He was one of the first. {{< var sam-full >}} was almost one of the pioneers who began in the {{< var heder >}} of {{< var goldfaden-full >}}. And throughout his entire career as a Yiddish actor, he was a mirror into those times.

Many remember when he was the the "buf"^[slapstick comedian] who sang couplets and danced. Many others also remember when he excelled in roles that {{< var mogu-full >}} played like "dos poylisher yingl"^[the Polish boy] from Professor Ish Horowitz Halevy; "Feitl Pavolye" in Nahum Meir Shaknovitch's (Shomer's) _Immigranten_. And the whole world remembers when he performed with David Kessler, Jacob P. Adler, and other notables like Shildkraut. He really excelled in character-comedy roles.

But just as life doesn't stay still forever, neither do the performing arts, but it instead evolves over time. The new young generation always arrives on the scene, bringing their own concepts and ideals to the stage. And in the end, these young performers emerge victorious because the old guard must give way to new, just as in life.

{{< var sam-full >}} was, in this case, an exception. He has always caught our eye and drawn our attention because he absorbed the theater atmosphere along with his mother's milk. His later activities on the Yiddish stage helped him a lot to become a famous actor, comedian, and _mensch_ and made him immensely popular on the stage.

{{< var sam-full >}} was the first to bring ordinary comedy to the Yiddish stage. His possesses a terrific enthusiasm, a lot of impetuousness, a booming presence and tempestuousness. Theater audiences always looked upon him with wonderment. When {{< var sam-full >}} danced such that the stage floorboards shook under his feet, he became energized and ignited with spirit, and his talent spilled out from him as he danced with a fiery passion in his eyes. He sang, danced, and burned with them. The great joy he derived from performing theater shook him up and gradually transformed into theatrical passion. He never grew tired and or apathetic, but always possessed an actor's ectasy. Both audiences and critics alike always held his talent in high esteem.

{{< var kestin >}}'s laughter was never contrived. Just like Mogulesko's, his comedic style was always entirely original, fresh, pure, and sincere. Just as his whole essence always gushed with passion and youth, so too did his talent.

His sole consolation in life over the last few years was his only surviving son Louie^[Lewis Kasten, 1902 - 1975]. When he spoke of Louie, tears would well up in his eyes. Many times, he used to say to his closest friends, "What would I do without my Louie?" Louie was more than just a son to Sam, but a companion, a friend. Louie had always called him "Sam." He was the only happiness^[The article uses גליק.] in Sam's life.

Eight or maybe ten weeks ago, {{< var sam-full >}} met the author of this very article, with whom he was a very dear friend, and no sooner than he saw him he called out:

"Sholem, when I die and they bury me in Philadelphia, I want you to promise me that you will come to my funeral and say a few words about me."

When the Hebrew Actor's Union chose me to go to {{< var sam-full >}}'s funeral in Philadelphia as the organization's representative, I accepted this honor with great respect and went to the funeral.

But, later, I returned home disappointed with a heavy weight on my heart. Louie {{< var kestin >}}, {{< var sam-full >}}'s son, told me that there will be no Yiddish "speeches." And when I explained to him that I came in the name of the Hebrew Actor's Union and also according to his own father's wishes, he answered me: "_I am very sorry_"^[Answered in English.]. And thus, not a single Yiddish word was spoken at {{< var sam-full >}}'s funeral. In protest, I left the hall and did not go to the cemetery. 

And to the audiences who protested that the Hebrew Actor's Union didn't take part in {{< var sam-full >}}'s funeral, the author of this article explains to them why exactly that was the case...

{{< var sam-full >}} served the Yiddish stage for nearly his entire life. He began his career in the old "Singer's Hall" in Brownsville on Watkins St. The music hall was called "Scheider's Singer Hall" because the manager was named Schneider. Other actors performed in various plays there too, like Jacob Frank, Max Gabel, Samuel Scheider, and Jacob Wexler. The star among them was Aaron Morgenbesser, and {{< var sam-full >}}, who played the "buf"^[slapstick] comedian roles, made the audiences laugh. But off stage, {{< var sam-full >}} could also be very serious. Very often, he would give a stern and sharp word when people needed to hear it. But those very words were never said from a place of anger, but from a place of seriousness.

Everyone who knew him got a lot of joy being in his company, because everyone knew and felt that {{< var sam-full >}} was a _harziger mensch_, a good companion, and a true friend.

ת׳נ׳צ׳ב׳ה!^[A hebrew acronym commonly used as epitaph and means "May his soul be bound in the bundle of life."]

**My dear old friend**^[He specifically uses a phrase meaning, "friend since youth."]

:::

By [Boaz Young](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/Y/young-bernard.htm)^[An actor and dear friend of Sam's. They had performed together since the 1890s.]

> For {{< var sam-full >}}'s [_shloshim_](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/371240/jewish/The-Shloshim.htm)

When you're sitting by yourself in a room in Los Angeles, and you look out at the beautiful, sunny weather, all kinds of thoughts come to mind. You think more about the past as eternity draws nearer... Suddenly you hear footsteps... They're the footsteps of the messenger who brings news - good news, bad news, to the people in the building. 

I run to meet him. He hands me a letter. Holding the letter in my hand, I feel that it barely weighs anything. I say to my myself: my friend, the actor [Mordechai Yachson](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/Y/yachson-mordechai.htm), _nebekh_, is so stingy he won't use more than a _shtikel_ paper. I open and take out a single piece of printed paper just three inches long, on which is a picture of my dear old friend, {{< var sam-full >}}.

I stay standing... and look at the picture and think: Is this shred of paper all I have left to remember him by, when such a thing should fill hundreds of sheets of paper... Memories of a 65-year-long friendship from my life in the theater. A life of hunger, wandering, licentiousness but also honor, fortune, and fame.

In my subconscious, events and episodes we experienced over the last 65 years of our life in the theater begin to swim around. And I think further: Is this bit of paper now the open grave where I bury the all the comical-tragic times we went both through together on the stage of our lives? We both married actresses who were friends like we were. And both of them gave us a daughter, who both (our children) died of the same illness (cancer). Almost at the same time, the witch, the old man, and Father Time with sickle in hand, cut short the lives of our own children. 

And now he has come for you at 85 years (I saw his naturalization papers^[Boaz here is implying that he alone _truly_ knows how old Sam is. The mystery lives on!]), and soon will come for me.

***

{{< var sam-full >}} absorbed the great Sigmond Mogulesko's essence itself and passed it along to the audiences in his own charming way. People used to call him the "Yiddish [George Cohan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Cohan)." {{< var kestin >}} was recognized as a first-class "buf-comedian"^[slapstick]. That's why I rewrote the melodrama _Di Bigamist'n_^[_The Bigamist_] by the late actor [Meisel](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/meisel-hyman.htm) into a musical called _Mayn Vayb's Man_^[_My Wife's Husband_] - or as they called it in Europe, _Semkele_, and created leading roles for both him and my wife [Clara Young](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/Y/young-clara.htm). I remember how he covered me with kisses when he came off from the stage after the duet he and Clara sang together in _Mayn Vayb's Man_ as the audience loudly applauded.

And I remember, in Baltimore, when the great tragedy happened in our theater and 34 people died^[Read Sam's account of this incident [in his memoirs](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/15_1946-11-07.html) where someone yelled fire in a theater because they mistook a flame from a gas pipe, and (more likely) 23 people were trampled in a stampede to escape.]. {{< var kestin >}} didn't perform in the play that evening. He was standing by the door manning the box office. He collected \$150. The play hadn't started yet, and the cash register was full of money. The next day, {{< var kestin >}} brought us back the money. We wanted to split up the \$150 among us, but {{< var sam-full >}} said to us,

"Colleagues, there are 34 funerals across the city today. At the box office, I sold a ticket to an aquaintance of mine and his wife. While trying to save her, he was trampled to death. His wife is now a widow with children without a provider. We didn't even perform the play - should we now divide up their dollars among us? I think," the young {{< var kestin >}}^[He would have been about 26.] continued, "that we should give the \$150 to the wives whose husbands and children were killed so horrifyingly in our theater. We should do something for them..."

And then {{< var kestin >}} gave the money to the committee which was arranged to support the wives of the deceased.

May this memory be a flower on your grave.

My departed colleague, my dear old friend {{< var sam-full >}}, together we were the last two Mohicans of the Yiddish theater... We arrived to the theater when he^[the theater, metaphorically] was just starting to stand on its own. We helped him walk, helped him pull the heavy wagon... Now, he's left not knowing what to do or where to go at all... with you gone... And I am left alone, the last Mohican...
