Ladies and gentlemen!

It has been established that the invention of the ["Hillel sandwich"](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/117121/jewish/10-Korech-The-Hillel-Sandwich.htm) - the same Hillel of [_"Beis Hillel"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Hillel_and_Shammai), the [_tane_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaim)^[rabbinic sages who contributed to the Mishnah] Hillel with a deep soul and exceptional love for his fellow man. Hillel invented the sandwich as a gift for all mankind...

Hillel held that man can [learn the whole Torah on one foot](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/689306/jewish/On-One-Foot.htm). Well, the Torah sure, but why stop there - why shouldn't we also **eat** on one foot? _Nu_, so he invented the "_korech_," which Americans call a "sandwich."

In happier times, you knew what to expect from a sandwich: two pieces of bread and a lot of meat, or cheese, or sardines...

Or there's the "double decker" and the "{{< var sam-full >}} stage-sandwich"^[In this joke article, we learn that {{< var sam >}} apparently had a well-known very large sandwich named for him!], three stories high...

But now during war time^[This article was printed in 1943 in the middle of World War II], the sandwich has lost its "essence," its "innards", its contents. All that remains is just two pieces of bread, _nebech_^["What a pity"]....

^[These two sentences are full of idioms, and translations may not be fully accurate.]There are restaurants where people don't cram your sandwich with Ibsen brand's _"gor"_....but with _"gornisht"_^[absolutely nothing]... There are restaurants that put a "huge check" in between two pieces of "toast"...

All in all, these days there are only two kinds of sandwiches - a meat sandwich without any trace of even a sardine, and a cheese sandwich which a thin slice of tomato instead of cheese.

In short, all that's left of the sandwich is its name, a tombstone of the great invention.
