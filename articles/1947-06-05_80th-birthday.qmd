The Yiddish theater world is now celebrating one of the most wonderful of holidays - {{< var sam-full >}}, the "littlest pinky finger" of our Yiddish theater, is, with _mazl_, turning 80 years old.

More than 70 years have already passed since {{< var goldfaden >}} laid the foundation stone of the Yiddish theater in the Romanian city of Iasi. And you could say that {{< var sam-full >}} was one of the pioneers who started out in the _kheder_ of {{< var goldfaden-full >}}. Each era of the Yiddish theater is clearly reflected in the manuscripts and in the plays, and also in the actors, of those times. 

It's enough to be familiar with the theater of a certain era to have a comprehensive understanding of the performing arts, the talent, and the taste of the audiences of those days. You can also understand the perspectives people held, and the ideals and ambitions that most of the great artists had. You can also clearly see the striking differences among diverse social classes and their attitudes towards the Yiddish theater.

Just like life, performing arts don't stay forever in one place, but slowly evolve, soon adopting new shapes and styles. The new young generation always brings new, talented performers who infuse the performing arts with their new beliefs and their new ideas.

And in the end, the young performers emerge victorious, and the older ones must, just as in life, cede their place to the young new talent.

An exception, however, who always catches your eye and keeps your full attention, is the "old-young" comedian {{< var sam-full >}}, whose 80th birthday will be celebrated the evening of Saturday June 7th in the [Clinton Theater](https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/13560). He truly deserves for people to come marvel at his great artistry and his popularity among the Jewish masses.

{{< var sam-full >}}, who imbibed the "Oral Torah" from the great comedian {{< var mogu-full >}}, is still going strong^[The real translation here is "goes with the flow"]. After 60-some years performing Yiddish theater, he still won't stop. Today, he says, he still plays the same roles as he used to play in the old days. And just like a stubborn general on the battlefield, he fights with all his might and clings to his strategy.

Among the great stars who have adorned the stage of the American Yiddish theater over the decades, the name {{< var sam-full >}} shines and glimmers "with a thousand graces." And even though {{< var sam-full >}} went through all seven levels of hell and endured all kinds of troubles and _tsures_ and trials over his long career on the Yiddish stage, his sparkle never diminished and his light never faded. He therefore deserves all the respect and honor that we can show him.

{{< var sam-full >}} is a performer who even today possesses everything an artist needs. His exaggerated comedic style is reminiscent of the great late actor {{< var mogu-full >}}, and just like {{< var mogu >}}, {{< var sam-full >}} has of all the characteristics and idiosyncracies of a stage artist. The Yiddish tune and the _khasidisher nigun_^[chasidic melody], the Jewish joke and the Jewish witticism, the Jewish humor and the ["mitzvah dance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvah_tantz), and even the Jewish _kvetching_ in all its forms - {{< var sam-full >}} embodies, just as {{< var mogu-full >}} did, all these treasures of Yiddish "folksiness" which were tightly intertwined with the Yiddish stage of old. It's so delicate that it's hard to put into words. You can only fully appreciate it when you see {{< var sam-full >}} perform on stage.

{{< var sam-full >}}'s laughter was never fake or manufactured, because his comedy, just like {{< var mogu >}}'s, was always an original one, a sincere one, a pure one, an honest one. And just as his entire being bursts with fieriness and youth, so too does his talent. If you want to be reminded of, or even just get a sense of, what it was like to see the famous great late actor {{< var mogu-full >}} perform, you have to go see {{< var sam-full >}}.

{{< var sam-full >}}, who is celebrating his 80th birthday in the Clinton Theater, began his career over 60 years ago in [Singer Hall on Pitkin Avenue](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/11_1946-10-24.html), where he excelled performing in all the roles that {{< var mogu >}} used to perform in those days in the Windsor, Thalia, and also in the People's Theaters. And just like {{< var mogu >}} always performed with [Rudolph Marks](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/marks-rudolph.htm), {{< var sam-full >}} would always perform with the late artist [Jacob Frank](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/F/frank-jacob.htm). Just like {{< var mogu >}} and Marks, both {{< var kestin >}} and Frank always looked alike. You could never tell between them who was the real Kuni-Lemel and who is the fake Kuni-Lemel^[Reference to ["The Two Kuni-Lemels"](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/F/frank-jacob.htm)].

For his 80th birthday jubilee, {{< var sam-full >}} has chosen to perform one of Abraham Goldfaden's first plays, [_Kaptsnzon et Hungerman_](https://web.uwm.edu/yiddish-stage/plotting-yiddish-drama/kaptsnzon-et-hungerman-oder-di-kaprizne-kale-moyd). All of his friends and admirers wish him long life and that the Jewish world will enjoy his talent for many years to come.
