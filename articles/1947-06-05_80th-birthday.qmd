The Yiddish theater world is now celebrating one of the most wonderful of holidays - {{< var sam-full >}}, the "littlest pink finger" of our Yiddish theater, is, with _mazl_, turning 80 years old.

Between "Yes and No", more than 70 years have already passed since {{< var goldfaden >}} laid the foundation strong of the Yiddish theater in the Romanian city of Iasi. And you could say that {{< var sam-full >}} was one of the pioneers who started out in the _kheder_ of {{< var goldfaden-full >}}. And each era of the Yiddish theater is clearly reflected in the manuscripts and in the plays, and also in the actors, of those times. 

It's enough to be familiar with the theater of a certain era, in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the performing arts, the talent, and the taste of the audiences of those days. You can also understand the perspectives people held, and the ideals and ambitions that most of the great artists had. You can also clearly see the striking differences among diverse social classes and their attitudes towards the Yiddish theater.

Just like life, performing arts don't stay forever in one place, but slowly evolve, soon adopting new shapes and styles. The new young generation always brings new, talented performers who infuse the performing arts with their new beliefs and their new ideas.

And in the end, these same young performers emerge victorious, and the old-time ones must, just as in life, cede their place to the young new talent.

An exception, however, who always catches your eye and keeps your full attention, is the "old-young" comedian {{< var sam-full >}}, whose 80th birthday will be celebrated the evening of Saturday June 7th in Clinton Theater.
