**{{< var kestin >}} must laugh at his troubles**


> The Yiddish comedian tells how he became an actor, and how "he got married because he had nothing to eat." -- Three Yiddish actors have one suit. -- How he would only get paid any wages if people came to the "theater-saloons"^[Vaudeville-esque Yiddish music halls]. -- Now he sings in "_Khantshe_"^[Short for _Khantshe in Amerike_, a play starring Bessie Thomashefsky [in which Sam had a small but mighty role](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/38_1947-01-25.html).] if he has somewhere to perform.


"I am a comedian. I am a professional "laugher;" my business is to make jokes; I make a living from making theatergoers happy. But, you know that making a living is no laughing matter? Earning your piece of bread is no joke, even when your trade is built around laughter... Whenever I make a joke that the audience doesn't love, it truly feels like Yom Kippur in my heart^[a somber occasion]."

{{< var kestin >}}, the Yiddish comedian, didn't exactly use those words with the {{< var forverts >}} reporter, but the thoughts he was expressing was the same.

"I learned to laugh true heartfelt laughter," {{< var kestin >}} continued, "in Svastine^[In his [memoirs](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/01_1946-09-07.html), Sam calls the village Zatishiye. It's more likely the village name in the memoirs is correct.], a village in the Kiev Governate, where I lived until I was 16. My father had a _possessiye_ (farm), and during my childhood, things went well for us and I didn't have any worries. But later, my father passed away, we came to America^[Sam glosses over quite a few details here! Read more in [chapters 1-5 of his memoirs](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/01_1946-09-07.html)], and I got to work. Months passed, and I got used to the feeling of not having a father. I used to sing, imitate, and parody everyone and make jokes, just like I did in Svastine. The shop^[He [worked as a shirtmaker](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/06_1946-10-03.html) for a period of time] would always be in stitches when I let myself go.

"A worker told the well-known theater manager Garstenstein about me, and he hired me. But soon, he broke away from the company and we were left without a manager. Then, a different company took over the theater (the Gaskill Street Theater in Philadelphia), and they hired me to play in a single show. At that time, Rudolph Marx was supposed to put on the play _The Orphan in Danger_^[The title recounted here is clearly orphan (יותם), but in most other sources this play is called _The Sailor in Danger_. Who knows!], and I was given a role. I went to rehearsals for two weeks but I didn't perform at first, because I pretended to get sick the evening of the performance. I did this so that I alone could appear in the play. During the two weeks of rehearsals, I copied the whole play, put together a company, rented a venue, and performed Rudolph Marx's successful play. We brought in \$60 at the box office. We were eight men, so we got about \$7 each. This was a huge amount, so we wanted to keep performing. But then, Boris Thomashefsky hired me, and that was the end of my company. I played with Thomashefsky for a little while, and when he was irritated he would pay me for my work with -- a compliment. Not money at all.

"My mother was always opposed to my interest in the stage. 'A young man of your age,' she would always scold me, 'should start thinking about a _tachles_ already. What, you think you can make a living playing in a ridiculous Purim spiel?' I promised her dozens of that I'd stop acting, but I never kept my promises. It ended up that she bought a farm with the few dollars she had from back home^[In Sam's memoirs, he instead says the family won \$10,000 in the lottery and bought the farm with that money](https://sjspielman.github.io/sam-kasten-memoirs/chapters/09_1946-10-17.html#footnotes). So I had to come down from the stage and become a farmer.

"A short time later, my mother passed away, and I could once again become an actor."


{{< var kestin >}} came to New York and was hired in a "variety"^[Vaudeville/beer and music hall] in Brownsville, Brooklyn. He was supposed to be paid \$6 a week, but he only rarely actually received this much.
