<br>

::: {layout-ncol=2}

Yesterday the famous comedian {{< var sam-full >}} was surprised by his friends and family with tens of telegrams wishing him a happy 65th birthday. {{< var kestin >}} is now playing in the Second Avenue Theater, and it's difficult for anyone to believe that he's really 65 years old.<br><br>
Yesterday, when the beloved actor came around Cafe Royal, a great number of actors and actresses surprised the "young-old" actor, who felt just like a _yongermentshik_^[young man], with well wishes in honor of his birthday.<br><br>
A group of his friends and colleagues organized a performance in {{< var sam-full >}}'s honor. Through this performance, the whole theater family will express their love and esteem for the great Yiddish actor.<br><br>
{{< var kestin >}} himself jokes about his 65 years. The younger comedians tell {{< var sam >}} that they feel older than him, but he takes it all in good fun and says, if they hadn't reminded him that he had turned 65 yesterday, he would have thought he was only in his forties.
