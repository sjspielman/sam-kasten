Welcome to the (at least temporarily called?) Sam Kasten Legacy Project, developed and maintained by [Stephanie J. Spielman](https://sjspielman.github.io).

Sam Kasten^[written in Yiddish as "Kestin": סעם קעסטין] (1869-1953), one of my paternal great-great grandfathers^[more specifically, my paternal grandmother's maternal grandfather], was a beloved comedian/song-and-dance man in the American Yiddish theater in the early 1900s. 

This website is an _in-progress_ landing page for materials reviving his legacy.
