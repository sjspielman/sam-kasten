Welcome to the Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as "Kestin") Legacy Project, developed and maintained by [Stephanie J. Spielman](https://sjspielman.github.io).

Sam Kasten (z''l, 1869-1953), one of my paternal great-great grandfathers (more specifically, my father's mother's mother's father), was a beloved comedian/song-and-dance man in the American Yiddish theater in the early 1900s. 

This website is an _in-progress_ landing page for materials reviving his legacy.
