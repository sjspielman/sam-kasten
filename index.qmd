Welcome to the Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as "Kestin") Legacy Project, developed and maintained by [Stephanie J. Spielman](https://sjspielman.github.io).

Sam Kasten (z'l, 1869-1953) is one of my paternal great-great grandfathers^[More specifically, he is my father's mother's mother's father] and was a beloved comedian/song-and-dance man in the American Yiddish theater in the early 1900s. 

This website is an _in-progress_ landing page for materials reviving his legacy.
