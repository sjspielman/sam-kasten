Spielman.\nSam Kasten (z’’l, 1869-1953), one of my paternal great-great grandfathers (more specifically, my father’s mother’s mother’s father), was a beloved comedian/song-and-dance man in the American Yiddish theater in the early 1900s.\nThis website is an in-progress landing page for materials reviving his legacy.\nLooking for his memoirs?

    "text": "By Berl Botvinik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a funny thing to be a 50-year-old yid. His name is Shmuel Kestin, and people call him Sam. His colleagues shout at him, “Say, Sam!” And Sam, who turns 50 in a few days, not only replies, but runs in jumping on one foot like a mischevious kheder boy, giving himself a slap on each of his two cheeks, and there he is: The 50-year-old yid Sam. Sam Kestin, the famous Yiddish comedian. The comedian who brings us joy and tickles our funny bone1. We laugh and have a good time. We laugh and feel in good health, because Sam Kestin is entertaining us. In looking at such a jolly, lively, charming comedian, you’d never believe that this “party animal”2 was 50 years old. Even his children3 almost look older than him. He isn’t only young on the stage, but he is young in his cheerful soul too. He is indeed young in his appearance and in how he lives his simple life. Kestin is one of those rare actors who actually discloses his age and doesn’t use 20-year-old photographs of himself in advertisements. The picture you see here of Kestin was only just taken, indeed right as he is about to turn 50. And this picture wasn’t taken with any makeup or massage, but just as Sam is. Look at him - at his energy, at his fervor, at what a cheerful guy he is. He looks like a regular boychik. And yet, it’s Reb Shmuel Kestin, a 50-year-old yid whose daughter is already grown and herself an actress on the Yiddish stage. Everyone loves Kestin. Not only does everyone love him when he is on stage and makes us believe that the whole world dances and sings and jumps just for us, but everyone also loves him in day-to-day life, because he is a good friend and a loving man - “a mentsh with a face of grace and with a soul of grace.” And that’s the main thing about Kestin. He isn’t only a dancer and a jumper. His every dance and his every jump are done with a thousand graces. Deep in his soul glows a true mentshlikher4 spark with joy and love for everyone. In his grace there is a modesty, a sincerity, an affability that accompanies him on the stage just as much as in his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to Forverts article.\n\n\n\n\n\nA comedian on the Yiddish stage is the only one who plays without any arrogance in melodramas. On the Yiddish stage, a comedian is also the same one who plays the court jester to the king in Shakespeare’s times. The comedian must reveal the bitter truth about the landlord, the boss, the lover, and the parvenu.\nThe comedian is the conscience of the Yiddish actors. Kestin isn’t only this way on the stage, but in real life as well. He is joyful when he walks along the streets of New York because he has a merry, pleasant soul. On top of his happiness, he has the good gifts of modesty, honesty, brotherhood, and a soul full of charm.\nSam Kestin - the comedian, the jumper - had a lot of serious troubles and tsures. Even now, he has sorrows just like all men have. As a mentsh with such a deep soul, he is almost moved to tears by the suffering of others. But Sam Kestin does not cry. Sam Kestin is no yidene5, as Teyve the Milkman used to say.\nWhen Kestin appears in serious roles, such as Sholem Asch’s Undzer Gloybn, he performs with humor. Even when he’s in a serious role, you’ll want to laugh and enjoy yourself because just seeing Sam Kestin on the stage brings joys to the depths of your heart. His whole appearance, his charming little beard6 with his charming voice, makes you feel so good that it restores your health. It’s a true delight to watch him perform, simply because it’s Sam Kestin doing the performing.\nHe’s already performed for 28 years on the Yiddish stage, and maybe indeed for a whole 30…\nHe was born in Kyiv, Russia, and came to America as a young man. Here in American, he worked as a “shirt operator” in a shop, and he was drawn to the stage as though by a klipe7.\nHis mother herself opened a shirt shop and wanted Sam to be the shop manager, but he ran away to become an actor8. He suffered, starved, froze, and endured terrible tsures just to earn his piece of bread from acting.\nBut now, he is the famous Sam Kestin, the 50-years-young yid, and he is one of a few highly paid Yiddish actors.\nWhen Kestin comes out in from of the audience, the whole stage is with him. It doesn’t matter what role he is playing. He is a character in and of himself. The charming actor Kestin is indeed a whole play unto himself, a 50-year-old play, as shiny and new as when it was first written.\nHis birthday is the 21st of April. He’ll be 50-years-old on that day. The Hebrew Actors' Union, where Sam is an active member who helps ensure that everyone is able to make a living from acting, will hold a yontif in honor of Kestin.\nA huge banquet is being arranged to which all manner of actors and actresses are invited. People can give gifts to and compliments to Sam, who will sit calmly and reserved as befits a yid who, kinehora9, is turning 50 years old."

    "text": "Link to Forverts article\n\n\nA big head, white as milk. A face, clear and youthful. Eyes, impish and childlike. Even though he’s turning 60 years old, he has the look of a 16-year-old kid. He dances and jumps up, rising with the enthusiasm and agility of a young slapstick comedian. Whether he is on the stage or in in some kind of Romanian cellar, he is always ready to pull a mischevious trick or make practical joke. He will never grow old. He really is one of those types - the sort who never gets old.\nYou know, of course, that we’re referring to no other than our dear Sam Kestin. He appeared in Ben Hador, in ?var:yiziat, and in ?var:goldfaden’s operettas. With the same passion as ever, he now sings and dances in ?var:rumshinsky’s operettas. He has performed with Adler, Kessler, and Mogulesko. He has also performed with Aaron Lebedev, Leon Blank, Ludwiz Satz, and Molly Picon.1\nThose who saw him perform some 30 years ago will swear to you on their life that he is still the same Kestin, with the same youthful energy as before.\nKestin has performed on the Yiddish stage for 44 years. He was 16 years old when he arrived in America, and he worked in his mother’s “shirt factory” before he become an actor. This was in Philadelphia. The first performance he appeared in was in the Dramatic Hall, which was located at 5th and Gaskill Sts. Now that theater is a Hungarian shul. He began his career in theater acting with Boris Thomashevsky. His first role was as a young boy who sang _“Heyse bobkelakh_”2 in ?var:goldfaden’s ?var:sorceress3.\nNo, Kestin didn’t regret leaving his mother’s factory to become an actor. He would probably now be a respected businessman. Had he stayed with his mother, he would certainly be wealthier than he is now. But he would not have had the interesting life of a stage artist. He would not have experienced all the ups and downs, the successes and failures, the struggles and the praises - all the bitter and sweet moments that make an actor’s life so fascinating and interesting.\nAnd Kestin’s career was certainly a lucky one!"
